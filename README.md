 # Understanding the Program:
   - This program is a simple contract written in Solidity.
   - Solidity is a programming language used for creating smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
   - The contract has a function that allows you to create your own token.

 # Setting Up Remix:
   - Go to the (https://remix.ethereum.org/).
   - Click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab on the left sidebar.
   - Set the "Compiler" option to version "0.8.4" (or another compatible version).
   - Click the "Compile HelloWorld.sol" button to compile your code.

 # Deploying the Contract:
   - Click on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left sidebar.
   - Deploy your contract.

# Interacting with the Contract:
   - Copy the account address after deploying the contract.
   - Use the mint function by pasting the account address.
   - Specify a value and transact.
   - Check your balance to see how much you have.
   - To deduct from your balance, follow a similar procedure with the mint function.

# Testing Your Program:
   - Now you can test the program you've created!
